    "First let's talk about what's new. This course will **still** take you from someone who either has completed Jeremy Howards [course](https://course.fast.ai) or who hasn't even **touched** fastai at all and take you to a level above most practitioners. We still start at an understanding of some Python, and maybe some PyTorch and take you further beyond.\n",
    "\n",
    "However it's been three years since the first came out and much has changed. New techiques have been released, changes to the framework have occured, and in these times concepts like *distributed computing* mean much more! As a result over **50%** of the course material is *completely new*. \n",

    "> Zach Mueller is probably the most active member of the fastai community. He is also very actively involved with fastai development. If there is one person who understands the fastai library through and through (apart from Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger), that is certainly Zach! He went out of his way to create a fabulous learning resource for us, Walk With Fastai. Numerous notebooks explaining how to work with the library to achieve wonderful results. A must read! - Radek Osmulski, Senior Data Scientist at NVIDIA AI"

    "> Walk with Fastai is the best source available for utilizing fastai and goes above and beyond what is available in the documentation. Zach somehow extracted all of the knowledge I wanted to know about fastai and combined it into blog posts, videos, and source code that are easy to follow and build on. If you want to use fastai, this is a great resource to reference. I've had to go back and forth a couple of times between the best source (between it and fastbook) and I think I've gotten more out of Walk with fastai. - Kevin Bird"

    "> I really enjoyed the vision section Zachâ€™s Walk with fastai series. His extension of the fastai keypoint example from a single point to multipoint was really great and importantly included covering the basics of doing ML well such as cleaning the data, ensuring the transforms make sense and so forth before starting any modelling - super critical to teaching deep learning. I loved that he then goes deeper and shows off how to customize a UNET for key point regression (because why not!) and really get the most out of the fastai API. Highly recommended as an accompaniment to the fastai course! - Morgan McGuire, Growth ML Engineer at Weights and Biases"
